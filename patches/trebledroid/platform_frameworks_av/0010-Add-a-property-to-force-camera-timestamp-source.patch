Subject: [PATCH 10/25] Add a property to force camera timestamp source

Some devices wrongly report their timesource
Camera's timesource can either be CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or CLOCK_BOOTTIME
The former doesn't increment in sleep, while the later does.
There is a camera HAL property for that, though some devices don't
report it properly.

This issue happens on Xiaomi Redmi 7A, it needs to force the value to 1

Add a property persist.sys.phh.camera.force_timestampsource to force
timestamp source.
