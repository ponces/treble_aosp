Subject: [PATCH 39/40] APM: Fall back to legacy voice call routing if creating
 audio patch failed

* On some MT6771 Q vendor devices, in-call audio is broken due to APM
  failing to create an HW audio patch for RX / TX devices.

> 03-28 11:56:42.300  1345  1345 W DeviceHAL: Error from HAL Device in
function create_audio_patch: Function not implemented
> 03-28 11:56:42.301  1358  1374 W APM_AudioPolicyManager:
createAudioPatchInternal patch panel could not connect device patch,
error -38
> 03-28 11:56:42.301  1358  1374 W APM_AudioPolicyManager:
createTelephonyPatch() error -38 creating RX audio patch

* Our previous attempt at fixing this by falling back to SW bridging was
  wrong, because SW bridging requires a corresponding audio policy
  configuration that includes said SW bridges, which is not the case on
  these devices.

* The sole reason why this was broken at all is that the new R behavior
  tries to use the newer `createAudioPatch` interface of the audio HAL,
  which is broken on these devices for telephony inputs and outputs,
  even though the HAL claims to support it.

* Let's fall back to pre-R behavior (i.e. using the legacy
  setOutputDevices() interface) whenever the new method fails. The
  legacy method takes care of TX (Mic input) as well, so we don't need
  to create the TX patch either.
